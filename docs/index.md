## _What is infima.space?_

[Infima Space](https://infima.space) showcases research projects from [Infima Labs](https://infimalabs.com). Dedicated to the
advancement of highly-interconnected virtual spaces, we believe the long-anticipated arrival of mainstream spatial computing is
near. We use this _space_ to aggregate and present our ideas and research on such technologies.

### Spatial Computing Research and Experimental Libraries

Below are excerpts from the Abstract or Introduction of current research endeavors. Each area of focus is accompanied by a
dedicated page on this site. When applicable, original research and code is made available.

* `space-rust` [Protocol](https://github.com/infimalabs/space-rust) (under development)

> ... the proposed solution rounds each three-dimensional (3D) floating-point coordinate—and all its unused dynamic range—to the
> nearest A15-encoded integer representation, one or more dimensions higher. It centers A15 inside the Weaire–Phelan honeycomb,
> or the Tetrastix prism, then equally discretizes all 3D floating-point space. The result is a numerically-stable, higher-order
> space that’s packable, stackable, and less than half the size in memory—assigning each high-dimensional coordinate to a
> consistent volume of 3D space shrinks the encoding of nearby coordinates, minimizes directional aliasing, and maintains
> compatibility with global ...
