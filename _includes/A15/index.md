**_Early Draft Release_**

</summary>

This [document](https://infima.space/A15.pdf) is replete with section-sized **(todo)** items, contains no references, and has
seen no review---it's _incomplete_. However, its code, research, and outcomes _are_ complete. In the wake of [Meta Connect
2023](https://www.metaconnect.com/en/home)---and the release of next-generation, _Meta Quest 3_ hardware---we believe [_open
access_](https://github.com/infimalabs/space) to its ideas and ensuing projects are of great value to competitive, full-body VR
experiences.

We invite everyone interested in this research to join us at its [GitHub project page](https://github.com/infimalabs/space). With
the understanding this document is incomplete, we also invite any questions and requests for math, code, or language
clarifications, corrections, comments, or other such communications in the form of [GitHub
issues](https://github.com/infimalabs/space/issues).

We are working _furiously_ on the first implementation of this
proposal---[space-rust!](https://github.com/infimalabs/space-rust)---and an exclusive implementation in [Grit
Paintball](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1323610/Grit_Paintball/). Following its release in [Grit
Paintball](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1323610/Grit_Paintball/), we intend to make the library more generally available on
its GitHub project page (and later, a standalone Unity Asset).

This research is favorably licensed under [CC-BY-4.0](https://github.com/infimalabs/space/blob/main/LICENSE). The one exception
is `A15.py`, i.e. the [code proving the concept](https://github.com/infimalabs/space/blob/main/A15/A15.py) (and generating all
figures seen here) which is even-more favorably licensed under MIT.
